<h1>🚑CDSS for Prehospital Management of Acute Ischemic Stroke-<i>Stroke Kinesis</i></h1>




<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Stroke Kinesis is a digital health prototype that supports stroke rehabilitation by guiding structured recovery activities, tracking progress over time, and translating patient performance into actionable insights for clinicians and caregivers. It is designed to strengthen continuity of care after discharge through simple workflows, measurable outcomes, and privacy conscious data handling.

<h2>The problem</h2>
Current-state BPMN (Stroke Care Pathway): This diagram captures the real-world flow from symptom recognition and 9-1-1 call through dispatch, EMS screening, ED triage and stroke-code activation, imaging (CT), treatment decision-making (e.g., thrombolysis/tPA or EVT), acute monitoring, and discharge planning. A major limitation of the current pathway is what happens after discharge: rehab activities, adherence, symptom tracking, and clinician follow-up are often fragmented across paper instructions, scattered appointments, and inconsistent home practice creating gaps in continuity, limited visibility into patient progress, and delayed escalation when issues emerge. This is exactly the gap Stroke Kinesis addresses by supporting structured home-based rehab sessions, progress tracking, and a clinician-friendly summary layer to strengthen post-acute continuity of care!

  <h2>The Solution</h2>
Future-state BPMN (with Stroke Kinesis (Green)):After acute stroke care and discharge, the patient is onboarded to Stroke Kinesis with a clinician-set rehab plan and safety thresholds. The app guides home rehab sessions, tracks adherence and symptoms, and flags risks early. Clinicians get a clear progress summary to adjust care sooner closing the post-discharge continuity gap.
